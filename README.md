# Make Change Project
## Week 1 homework

This is my first assignment with Skill Distillery. The focus of this project is to design a program that will provide change based on the amount of an item and the cash provided by a customer. This program is being completed after 1 week of Java training.

### Goals!
At this point in the training I feel the area that I am weakest in is methods and the passing of variables between methods. With that being said, I will be using methods heavily in this program to help in learning this important concept. My second major goal is to complete the project with functional program; meeting all stated requirements.
